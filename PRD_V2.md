### 5. Hybrid Database Model (SQLite Local → PostgreSQL Production)
**Database Tables (Same schema for both SQLite and PostgreSQL)**
- **user_sessions** (session_id, created_at, expires_at)
- **documents** (id, session_id, file_name, file_url, file_type, upload_timestamp)
- **user_inputs** (id, session_id, input_type, field_name, field_value, timestamp)
- **tax_calculations** (id, session_id, gross_income, tax_old_regime, tax_new_regime, total_deductions, net_tax, calculation_timestamp)
- **ai_conversations** (id, session_id, user_message, ai_response, timestamp)

**Environment-Based Database Selection:**
- **Local Development:** SQLite database file (./local_database.db)
- **Production:** Vercel Postgres with connection pooling

### 6. User Interface Design Principles
- **Minimal & Professional UI optimized for Vercel**
- Clear sections for:
  - Uploading and displaying PDFs side-by-side with input forms
  - Manual data entry with AI-guided validation
  - Real-time tax calculations display
  - Interactive AI chat for tax advice
- Progressive web app features for mobile optimization
- Responsive design with Bootstrap components

### 7. Security Considerations
- Session-based access with secure session IDs
- Temporary file storage with automatic cleanup
- HTTPS encryption (automatic with Vercel)
- No persistent user data storage (GDPR compliant)
- API rate limiting for Gemini Flash 2.0 Pro calls
